# SpotifyAPI
Python project to work with the Spotify Web API. My first serious, independent Python project, and my first time working with APIs.

## Project Structure

This project contains 4 files. 3 represent Spotify Clients, used to communicate with the Spotify Web API. The last one ("navigator.py"), uses selenium to get an access token that requires a user's personal information (Spotify username & password).


## Search Client


## Playlist Client


## Browse Client


## Navigator
